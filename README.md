# C programming language datastructure

This project introduced the basic algorithms. The most useful data structure list, binary tree and graphic and so on. Here I used many words to show what is features of those data structure. I think you will more clear this data structure.

But I want to say that those algorithms are not complete, they are just demos. If you want to use just clone and add the main function. I just use some basic interfaces to show how to call them.

And I will add more and complete functions to this project.

After two years work, I used C++, python and java. And then I read this code, a lot of thoughts. But the biggest problem is that I can't understand the code. The C is very old and the datastructure is very complex. But It can makes you more carefully to write the codes. Don not forget it......
