# datastructure

This project introduced the basic algorithms. The most useful data structure list, binary tree and graphic and so on.
Here I used many words to show what is features of those data structure. I think you will more clear this data structure.

But I want to say that those algorithms are not complete, they are just demos. If you want to use just clone and add the 
main function. I just use some basic interfaces to show how to call them.

And I will add more and complete functions to this project.
